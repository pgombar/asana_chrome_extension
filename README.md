# asana_chrome_extension
A Chrome extension for Asana.

# Background
Asana is a task managing tool. With new updates, the task numbers got removed from the task list. We didn't like this, so we brought them back.

Developed during Noom's October 2015 Hackathon (Hacktoberfest).

# Usage
In Chrome, go to `Settings` > `More Tools` > `Extensions` > `Load unpacked extension...` and select the root folder of the extension. Go to your task list in Asana and watch the magic happen.
